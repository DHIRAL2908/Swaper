# Swaper
First, you have to enter the no. of digits in your number...
The Swaper allows you to enter a number with its digits separated by the 'enter'/'return' key.
After that it will give you your original input and the reversed/swaped number.

FILE DETAILS:
Swaper.exe => The main executable file.
Swaper.cbp => Project file for Code::Blocks.
main.cpp => The C++ source file.

If I get any support or time, I may make a letter reverser!
